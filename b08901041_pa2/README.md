## How to compile
make sure you are in the same level as *makefile*, and then just type `make` in your terminal. The exe file will be created and stored in the ***bin*** directory.

## How to run
After compiling the code, just type the command below:
```
bin/mps <input file path> <output file path>
```
For example, if you would like to run your binary for the input file 100000.in in the ***inputs*** directory and generate a solution named 100000.out in the ***outputs*** directory, the command is as follows:
```
bin/mps inputs/100000.in outputs/100000.out
```
